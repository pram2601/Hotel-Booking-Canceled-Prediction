# Hotel Booking Canceled Prediction

Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not, based on historical customer data. The project aims to assist hotel management in optimizing their planning and resource allocation.

Project Output:

The output of this project is a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled. The model can be implemented into the hotel's reservation system to provide early warnings about potential cancellations, enabling management to take appropriate preventive actions.

Brief Explanation of the Data Used:

The data used in this project consists of historical hotel booking records. It includes various attributes such as customer information, booking dates, length of stay, number and type of rooms booked, prices, and more. This data serves as the foundation for training and testing the machine learning model.

Method Used:

The project utilizes machine learning, specifically classification techniques. The data is divided into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data to identify patterns and relationships between attributes and booking cancellation status. The trained model is then evaluated using the testing data to assess its predictive capabilities.

Project Advantages:

    Helps hotel management identify opportunities to reduce booking cancellations and improve operational efficiency.
    Provides early predictions of potential cancellations, enabling timely actions to be taken.
    Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization, facilitating development and documentation.

Project Limitations:

    The quality of model predictions may be affected by the limitations of historical data.
    The machine learning model cannot account for unforeseen factors or sudden events that may impact booking cancellations.
    Regular data updates are required to maintain the quality and accuracy of the predictions.
